# EKGQuest Roadmap

Goal: world-class ECG teaching lab — MUSE-style viewing/printing + explainable measurements + high-fidelity pediatric synthetic cases (no waveform watermark).

## Non-negotiables
- Educational use; not for diagnosis/patient care.
- No waveform watermark; provenance lives in metadata + UI chrome (hideable in quiz mode).
- One canonical ECG JSON schema.

## Milestones
- M1: Flagship Lab page + mm-perfect rendering + worker analysis contract
- M2: Teach/Quiz modes + grading + case packs
- M3: Synth realism v1 + truth-based self-tests + validation harness
- M4: Visual/perf regressions in CI + GitHub Pages deploy
- M5: Pedagogy polish + lesson flows
